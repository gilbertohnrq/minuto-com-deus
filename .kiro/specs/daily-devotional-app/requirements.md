# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a daily devotional mobile application built with Flutter. The MVP focuses on delivering daily devotional messages through push notifications, with a clean and accessible user interface. The app will initially work offline using local JSON data, with future expansion planned for authentication, premium features, and additional content types (astrology and tarot).

## Requirements

1. WHEN the user opens the app THEN the system SHALL display the home screen with today's devotional message
2. WHEN displaying the devotional message THEN the system SHALL show the date, biblical verse, and reflection text (3-5 lines)

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load devotional content from local JSON file
2. WHEN loading devotional data THEN the system SHALL parse JSON with fields: data, versiculo, mensagem
3. WHEN determining today's message THEN the system SHALL match current date with devotional data
4. WHEN the JSON file is corrupted or missing THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate with my email or Google account, so that I can have a personalized experience and access premium features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL check if user is already authenticated
2. IF user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect to login screen
3. WHEN user chooses email login THEN the system SHALL validate email format and password requirements
4. WHEN user chooses Google Sign-In THEN the system SHALL use Firebase Authentication with Google provider
5. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN the system SHALL persist user session and navigate to home screen
6. WHEN user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear session and return to login screen

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want my profile information stored securely, so that my preferences and subscription status are maintained across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN user updates profile information THEN the system SHALL sync changes to Firestore
3. WHEN determining user access level THEN the system SHALL check isPremium field from user profile
4. WHEN user data is accessed THEN the system SHALL ensure proper security rules are applied

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add personal reflections to daily devotionals, so that I can deepen my spiritual practice and track my thoughts over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a devotional THEN the system SHALL display a text input field for personal reflections
2. WHEN user adds a reflection THEN the system SHALL save it locally with the devotional date
3. WHEN user submits a reflection THEN the system SHALL update their reading streak
4. WHEN displaying a devotional with existing reflection THEN the system SHALL show the saved reflection text
5. WHEN user edits an existing reflection THEN the system SHALL update the saved reflection

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my reading streak progress with engaging animations, so that I feel motivated to maintain daily devotional practice.

5. WHEN user achieves milestone streaks (7, 30, 100 days) THEN the system SHALL show special celebration animations

### Requirement 8
